# Optimizing-Stock-Mutual-Fund-Portfolios-A-Barometer-Bareksa-Study-Using-Mean-Semivariance-Method
A portfolio is a collection of assets in the form of investments owned by individuals or companies, the form of assets can be stocks, gold, deposits, and others (Rachman et al., 2015).

Markowitz (1991) revealed that semivariance makes more sense to calculate risk because investors are more concerned about portfolios whose performance is below the benchmark than portfolios whose performance is above the benchmark, so semivariance is more appropriate to use as a measure of risk than variance. 

This study focuses on mutual funds, the most popular investment product today, with an emphasis on minimizing investment risk. Portfolio formation involves combining multiple assets using the Mean-Semivariance method and the Sharpe Index to assess portfolio performance.

The dataset includes daily net asset values of Mandiri Investa Atraktif Syariah, Rencana Cerdas, Manulife Saham SMC Plus, and BNP Paribas Solaris from January 3, 2022, to March 9, 2023, alongside Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) data as a benchmark and BI-7 Day Reverse Repo Rate as the risk-free interest rate.

The resulting portfolio, consisting of Mandiri Investa Atraktif Syariah (weighted at 92.50%) and Rencana Cerdas (weighted at 7.50%), achieves a minimum risk with an expected return rate of 0.00019 and a risk of 0.000000663. The Sharpe Index of 0.08971 indicates good portfolio performance, making it an attractive investment option for investors.
